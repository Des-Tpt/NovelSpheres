NovelSphere is a small project of mine aimed at building a story-sharing website. There's no profound reason behind it. I'm doing this project to improve my coding skills and programming mindset while increasing my proficiency with Next.js and TypeScript.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
